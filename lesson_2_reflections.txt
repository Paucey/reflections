What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a Git Repository creates a ".git" directory in the directory that you're
working within. Why do I need to do it? That's a good question. The fact that the
commit process doesn't actually start until you _add_ files to the commit makes
it seem like this step is unnecessary. One would think that if one tried to add a file
to a directory that was without a ".git" directory that one would simply be created.
That being said, perhaps there are other background framework processes that I'm
still unaware of? It's hard to say!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to prepare your files for a commit. You can see what you're
going to be adding and if you need to make changes you still can before, pun intended,
"committing". It also allows you, I imagine, to add a commit message before the commit
is made and to adjust it - but, perhaps that is only done at time of commit. Basically
I see it as a chance to ensure you're satisfied with how your commit will look before
creating it.
