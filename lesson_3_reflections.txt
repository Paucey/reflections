When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working with others or when I need to work on my repository from multiple locations
or devices. Or, when I want to ultimately share what I'm making with the public -
something I'm only making for myself and on a single system likely won't need a
remote repository. Also, having a remote repository allows me to keep a safe backup
in case something were to happen to my local version (though the two aren't
automatically kept up to date with each other).
